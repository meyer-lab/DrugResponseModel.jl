def generateLineageWithTime(initCells, experimentTime, locBern, g1_a=None, g1_b=None, g2_a=None, g2_b=None):
    """
    generates a list of objects (cells) in a lineage.

    Given an experimental end time, a Bernoulli distribution for
    dividing/dying and two Gamma parameters for cell lifetime,
    it creates objects as cells and puts them in a list.


    Bernoulli distribution:
        It has one parameter (locBern)
        If locBern = 0.80 then 80% of the times the cells will divide and 20%
        of the times they die; meaning, for every cell that is generated,
        a random number (either 1:divide, or 0:die) is picked from the
        distribution with this parameter and the fate of the cell is assigned.


    Gamma distribution:
        It has two parameters(shape , scale) {here are a and b}
        Used as alifetime generator for cells. Here to generate the cells we
        specify the two parameters and it will return a number that we assign to cell's
        lifetime, as G1 phase and G2 phase of the cell cycle.

    Args:
    -----
        initCells (int): the number of initial cells to initiate the tree with
        experimentTime (int) [hours]: the time that the experiment will be running
        to allow for the cells to grow
        locBern (float): the Bernoulli distribution parameter
        (p = success) for fate assignment (either the cell dies or divides)
        range = [0, 1]
        g1_a, g2_a: shape parameters of Gamma for G1 and G2 phase of the cell cycle.
        g1_b, g2_b: scale parameters of Gamma for G1 and G2 phase of the cell cycle.
