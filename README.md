# Drug Response Model
This is to show oscillations in the number of cells in G1 and in G2 phase of cell cycle in some cancer cell lines, in response to different concentrations of a number of chemotherapy drugs, including gemcitabine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and lapatinib. 


<!-- ### Here is a way to use the DDEmodel

```ruby
include("importData.jl")
include("DDEmodel.jl")
include("plot.jl")

# import data from the path
pop, g2, g1, g1_0, g2_0 = get_data("..//data//lap.csv", "..//data//lap_pop.csv"); # in which:
# pop: population data
# g1, g2: g1 and g2 data
# initial: initial number of cells in g1 and in g2 at time 0

# This is to load the estimated parameters to be used as "initial guess"
param_lap_dde = CSV.read(".//ddeParams//Lapatinib//params_lap_DDE.csv")

# initial guesses for the parameters
lap = convert(Matrix, param_lap_dde[1:7,2:end]); 


# i is the number of the column we are using from the data (# of trial)
i = 6

# initial guess
p  = [0.02798, 0.025502, 21.3481, 10.2881, 0.0001, 0.0001]

# setting lowest delay for tau1 to be half an hour and for tau2 to be 3 hours.
low = [0.015, 0.003, 0.5, 3.0, 7.0, 0.0001, 0.0001]
upp = [0.075, 0.075, 30.0, 30.0, 100.0, 0.05, 0.05]

# Estimating the parameters for trial i
params = optimIt(p, low, upp, i, g1, g2)

# Plotting the long-term prediction along with the data for trial i
plotIt(params, g1, g2, g1_0, g2_0, pop, i, "Lapatinib")

```
